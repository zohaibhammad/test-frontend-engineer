# Frontend Developer Take-Home Test

## Overview

Develop a responsive e-commerce web application that allows users to browse products, view product details, and add products to a shopping cart.
The application should integrate with a backend API to fetch product data.

- The goal is a clear demonstration of quality, functionality, and thought process.
- **Timebox:** The test is designed to be completed in 6 hours or less.
- **Commit Often:** Show your working process through regular commits.
- **External dependencies:** Use any external dependencies you see fit, you do not need to implement everything from scratch.
- **Keep It Minimal:** Use lightweight libraries and avoid adding unnecessary features, or over-engineering the solution.

## Requirements

### Functional

1. **Product Listing Page**
    - Display a list of products with images, names, and prices.

    - Handle loading states and error handling gracefully.
    - API should be typed using TypeScript.

- **Code Quality**
    - Apply **SOLID principles** and design patterns.
    - Write consistent, clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
    - Create universal and reusable UI components.

- **Testing**
    - Write unit tests for critical components (optional).

## Getting Started

1. **Fork this Repository**
    - You can start by forking this repository.

2. **Setup Project**
